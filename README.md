# Connect Four
### About
This is a command line version of Connect Four in Ruby. The main purpose of creating this program is to become familiar with the RSpec DSL, and the process of test-driven development.

### Getting Started
A live version of this program is hosted on this [Repl.it IDE](https://repl.it/@coped/connect-four). Otherwise, you can download this repository, navigate to its root directory, and run the program with the command:
```
ruby lib/main.rb
```
